"This project is a Real-Time To-Do List application built with React and Socket.IO. The server and each client maintain a synchronized array of tasks, making the list shareable across multiple users in real-time. Features include the ability to add and remove tasks, with real-time updates pushed to all connected clients. The application serves as an in-depth exploration of WebSockets, focusing on immediate data synchronization between the server and clients.
